# Project Results – Classifying Pet Images

Final results from running `check_images.py` for all three CNN model architectures via `run_models_batch.sh`. Output was generated by `print_results.py` and piped into `resnet_pet-images.txt`, `alexnet_pet-images.txt`, and `vgg_pet-images.txt`.

## Results Table

| Statistic | ResNet | AlexNet | VGG |
|-----------|--------|---------|-----|
| **N Images** | 40 | 40 | 40 |
| **N Dog Images** | 30 | 30 | 30 |
| **N NotDog Images** | 10 | 10 | 10 |
| **% Correctly Classified Dogs** (Objective 1) | 100.0 | 100.0 | 100.0 |
| **% Correctly Classified Not-a-Dog** (Objective 1) | 90.0 | 100.0 | 100.0 |
| **% Correctly Classified Dog Breeds** (Objective 2) | 90.0 | 80.0 | **93.3** |

These values match the format and expected results from the project: VGG and AlexNet achieve 100% on dog/not-a-dog; VGG has the best breed accuracy (93.3%).

## How the Program Addresses the Project Objectives

This project had two main objectives:

### Objective 1: Identifying which pet images are of dogs and which are not

- **Implementation:** `adjust_results4_isadog()` loads `dognames.txt` and, for each image, sets whether the pet label and the classifier label are “dog” or not. `calculates_results_stats()` then computes:
  - **% Correctly Classified Dogs** – of the 30 dog images, how many the classifier correctly labeled as dog.
  - **% Correctly Classified Not-a-Dog** – of the 10 non-dog images, how many the classifier correctly labeled as not-a-dog.
- **Results:** VGG and AlexNet get 100% on both. ResNet gets 100% on dogs but 90% on not-a-dog (one cat misclassified as dog).

### Objective 2: Classifying the breeds of dogs (for images that are dogs)

- **Implementation:** `classify_images()` compares the classifier’s breed label to the pet label (from the filename). `calculates_results_stats()` computes **% Correctly Classified Dog Breeds** over the 30 dog images.
- **Results:** VGG is best at 93.3% (28/30 correct breeds). ResNet is 90.0% (27/30). AlexNet is 80.0% (24/30).

## Best Model Architecture

**VGG** is the best model for this task:

- It matches AlexNet on Objective 1 (100% dog, 100% not-a-dog).
- It has the highest breed accuracy (93.3%) and outperforms ResNet (90%) and AlexNet (80%).
- ResNet does better on breeds than AlexNet but fails to match VGG and AlexNet on dog/not-a-dog (ResNet misclassifies one non-dog as dog).

So VGG is the only architecture that reaches 100% on dog/not-a-dog and also has the best breed classification.

## Generated Output Files

The batch script runs `print_results()` for each model and redirects output to:

- `resnet_pet-images.txt`
- `alexnet_pet-images.txt`
- `vgg_pet-images.txt`

Each file contains the same six statistics (N Images, N Dog Images, N NotDog Images, Pct Corr dog, Pct Corr NOTdog, Pct Corr Breed) in the format produced by `print_results.py`, plus optional misclassification lists when requested.
